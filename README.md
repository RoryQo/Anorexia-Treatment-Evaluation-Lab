Evaluate the effectiveness of treatment types for anorexia using T tests, permutation tests, and QQ-plots


#### Context

The primary diagnosis for anorexia is a weight that is less than 85% of what is considered normal for that personâ€™s height and age. In this population of patients, researchers consider a patient anorexic if his or her weight is lower than 90 lbs. 

#### Data
There are three types of treatments, control treatment, family treatment, and cognitive/behavioral treatment.  The columns Before and After are the weights of the patients before and after the treatments, respectively. The last column Y is the difference of weights: After - Before.
