Evaluate the effectiveness of treatment types for anorexia using T tests, permutation tests, and QQ-plots


#### Context

The primary diagnosis for anorexia is a weight that is less than 85% of what is considered normal for that personâ€™s height and age. In this population of patients, researchers consider a patient anorexic if his or her weight is lower than 90 lbs. 

#### Data
There are three types of treatments, control treatment, family treatment, and cognitive/behavioral treatment.  The columns Before and After are the weights of the patients before and after the treatments, respectively. The last column Y is the difference of weights: After - Before.

#### Results 
While the difference in the presence of anorexia is not significantly less in the cognitive/behavioral treatment group than in the control treatment, there was significantly more weight gain in the cognitive/behavioral treatment group. After confirming our equal variance assumptions and validating these results with a permutation test.  These results indicate that while the treatment is effective, it may take multiple rounds of this therapy to induce enough weight gain that the patients no longer meet the clinical diagnostic criteria for anorexia.
